# Legal Documents Hosting Instructions

## üìã Overview

This guide explains how to host the legal documents required for Play Store submission. The documents have been prepared in HTML format for web accessibility.

## üìÅ Generated Files

The following HTML files have been created in the `docs/` folder:

1. **`index.html`** - Main landing page with app information and links to legal documents
2. **`privacy-policy.html`** - Complete privacy policy with COPPA compliance
3. **`terms-of-service.html`** - Comprehensive terms of service

## üöÄ Hosting Options

### Option 1: GitHub Pages (Recommended)

**Prerequisites**: GitHub repository

**Steps**:
1. Commit the `docs/` folder to your GitHub repository
2. Go to your repository Settings
3. Navigate to "Pages" section
4. Set source to "Deploy from a branch"
5. Select `main` branch and `/docs` folder
6. Click "Save"

**Result**: Your documents will be available at:
- `https://[username].github.io/[repository-name]/`
- `https://[username].github.io/[repository-name]/privacy-policy.html`
- `https://[username].github.io/[repository-name]/terms-of-service.html`

### Option 2: Firebase Hosting

**Prerequisites**: Firebase project setup

**Steps**:
1. Install Firebase CLI: `npm install -g firebase-tools`
2. Login to Firebase: `firebase login`
3. Initialize hosting: `firebase init hosting`
4. Set public directory to `docs`
5. Deploy: `firebase deploy`

**Result**: Documents available at your Firebase hosting URL

### Option 3: Static Hosting Services

Upload the `docs/` folder to any static hosting service:
- **Netlify**: Drag and drop the docs folder
- **Vercel**: Connect GitHub repository
- **Surge.sh**: Use CLI to deploy
- **GitHub Pages**: Follow Option 1

## üìù Required Updates

### 1. Update Contact Information

Replace placeholder contact information in both HTML files:
- `[Company Address]` ‚Üí Your actual business address
- `[Phone Number]` ‚Üí Your support phone number
- `privacy@aac-communication-helper.com` ‚Üí Your actual email
- `support@aac-communication-helper.com` ‚Üí Your actual email
- `coppa@aac-communication-helper.com` ‚Üí Your actual email

### 2. Update App Configuration

After hosting, update your Flutter app to reference the hosted URLs:

**In `lib/screens/settings_screen.dart`** (or wherever you want to add legal links):

```dart
import 'package:url_launcher/url_launcher.dart';

class LegalSection extends StatelessWidget {
  // Replace with your actual hosted URLs
  final String privacyPolicyUrl = 'https://your-domain.com/privacy-policy.html';
  final String termsOfServiceUrl = 'https://your-domain.com/terms-of-service.html';

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      children: [
        ListTile(
          title: Text('Privacy Policy'),
          subtitle: Text('Read our privacy policy'),
          leading: Icon(Icons.privacy_tip),
          onTap: () => _launchUrl(privacyPolicyUrl),
        ),
        ListTile(
          title: Text('Terms of Service'),
          subtitle: Text('Read our terms of service'),
          leading: Icon(Icons.description),
          onTap: () => _launchUrl(termsOfServiceUrl),
        ),
      ],
    );
  }

  Future<void> _launchUrl(String url) async {
    final Uri uri = Uri.parse(url);
    if (await canLaunchUrl(uri)) {
      await launchUrl(uri);
    }
  }
}
```

**Add URL launcher dependency to `pubspec.yaml`**:
```yaml
dependencies:
  url_launcher: ^6.2.5
```

### 3. Play Store Console Configuration

When setting up your Play Store listing, provide these URLs:
- **Privacy Policy URL**: `https://your-domain.com/privacy-policy.html`
- **Terms of Service URL**: `https://your-domain.com/terms-of-service.html`

## üîç Verification Steps

### Test Your Hosted Documents

1. **Accessibility Test**: Ensure URLs are publicly accessible
2. **Mobile Test**: Verify documents display correctly on mobile devices
3. **Link Test**: Check that privacy policy and terms of service link to each other
