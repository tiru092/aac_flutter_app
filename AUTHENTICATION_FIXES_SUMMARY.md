  - Added 500ms delay after sign-in to allow Firebase sync
  - Better error messages and debugging
  - Helpful snackbar messages for verification status

- âœ… **Added "Skip for now" option** in `VerifyEmailScreen`
  - Users can bypass verification if stuck
  - Shows confirmation dialog
  - Displays warning message about limited features
  - Allows users to verify later in profile

## âœ… **Sign Out Feature**

**Status:** âœ… **ALREADY IMPLEMENTED**

The profile screen already has a complete sign-out feature:
- Sign out button in profile settings
- Confirmation dialog with user email
- Proper navigation back to login screen
- Error handling for sign-out failures
- Located in `lib/screens/profile_screen.dart` around line 710

## âœ… **Payment Setup Answer**

**Question:** Do we need separate payment setup since Play Store will handle it?

**Answer:** âœ… **NO SEPARATE SETUP NEEDED**

- Google Play Store handles ALL payment processing
- Google takes 15% commission (first $1M) / 30% (above $1M)
- No need for Stripe, PayPal, or other payment processors
- Your app already has subscription UI and logic ready
- Just need to integrate Google Play Billing when publishing

See `PAYMENT_SETUP_GUIDE.md` for complete details.

## âœ… **How To Test The Fixes**

### Test Authentication Flow:
1. **Sign Up Test:**
   - Create new account with email/password
   - Check if verification email is sent
   - Try to login before verifying (should redirect to verification screen)

2. **Email Verification Test:**
   - Click verification link in email
   - Try "I've Verified My Email" button (should work now)
   - If stuck, try "Skip for now" option

3. **Login Test:**
   - Login with verified email (should work smoothly)
   - Login with unverified email (should show verification screen with options)

4. **Sign Out Test:**
   - Go to Profile screen
   - Use sign out button (already implemented)
   - Confirm proper navigation back to login

### Debug Information:
- Check console logs for authentication debugging
- Look for "AuthService:" and "AuthWrapperService:" log messages
- Verification status should be logged clearly

## âœ… **Expected Results**

After these fixes:
- âœ… Email verification should work reliably
- âœ… Users won't get stuck in verification loops
- âœ… Better error messages and user guidance
- âœ… "Skip for now" option prevents user frustration
- âœ… Sign out already works in profile screen
- âœ… Ready for Google Play Store publication (no separate payment setup needed)

## âœ… **Next Steps**

1. **Test the authentication flow thoroughly**
2. **Verify email verification works end-to-end**
3. **Test the "skip for now" option**
4. **Confirm sign out works from profile**
5. **Prepare for Google Play Store submission when ready**

The authentication issues should now be resolved! ðŸŽ‰
