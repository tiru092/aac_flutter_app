   - Includes requesting, commenting, and information sharing

2. **Operational Goals**
   - Based on Beukelman & Mirenda (2012) - AAC system navigation
   - Focuses on technical competence and system mastery
   - Includes navigation, message construction, and device operation

3. **Social Communication Goals**
   - Based on Prizant & Wetherby (1998) - Social pragmatic communication
   - Focuses on social interaction and pragmatic skills
   - Includes greetings, turn-taking, and conversation maintenance

### Specific Goals Implemented

#### Expressive Language (4 goals)
1. **Request Preferred Items (2 Symbols)** - Beginner level
2. **Comment on Activities (3-4 Symbols)** - Intermediate level
3. **Share Information/Experiences** - Intermediate level
4. **Ask Complex Questions** - Advanced level

#### Operational (4 goals)
1. **Navigate AAC System** - Beginner level
2. **Use Category Organization** - Beginner level
3. **Build Multi-Word Messages** - Intermediate level
4. **Use Grammar and Word Prediction** - Advanced level

#### Social Communication (4 goals)
1. **Use Appropriate Greetings** - Beginner level
2. **Initiate Conversations** - Intermediate level
3. **Take Turns in Conversation** - Intermediate level
4. **Understand Communication Partners** - Advanced level
