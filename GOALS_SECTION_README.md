## Integration

The Goals Section is accessed through a **Practice Goals icon** (⭐) located next to the search bar in the top control row of the home screen. Tapping this icon opens a full-screen Practice Goals interface.

### Navigation Flow
1. **Home Screen** → **Practice Goals Icon** (⭐) → **Practice Goals Screen**
2. **Practice Goals Screen** → **Goal Card** → **Practice Screen** 
3. **Practice Screen** → **Back** → **Practice Goals Screen** → **Back** → **Home Screen**

### Data Model
```dart
PracticeGoal {
  String id, name, description
  String iconPath, iconEmoji, color
  List<PracticeActivity> activities
  int completedActivities, totalStars
  double progress
}

PracticeActivity {
  String id, name, description
  PracticeType type
  List<PracticeItem> items
  bool isCompleted, int starsEarned
}
```

## Usage

### For Portrait (Vertical) View:
- Goals appear as horizontally scrollable cards
- Each card shows goal icon, name, description, and progress
- Tap any card to open the practice screen
- Cards are sized for easy thumb navigation

### For Landscape (Horizontal) View:
- Goals appear in a responsive grid (3-5 columns based on screen width)
- Compact layout optimizes for wider screens
- Font sizes and paddings automatically adjust
- More goals visible at once

### Practice Activities:
- Each goal contains 10 practice activities
- Activities progress sequentially
- Star rewards for correct answers
- Immediate audio and visual feedback
- Completion screen with celebration

## Customization

### Colors
Each goal has its own unique color theme stored as hex values in the data model.

### Content
All practice items are defined in `PracticeGoalsData.getAllGoals()` and can be easily modified or expanded.

### Animations
Animation durations and curves can be adjusted in the respective widget controllers.

## Technical Notes

- Uses `LayoutBuilder` and `MediaQuery` for responsive design
- Implements `TickerProviderStateMixin` for smooth animations  
- Integrates with existing `AACHelper` for speech synthesis
- Follows Material Design principles with Cupertino icons
- Uses `AutoSizeText` to prevent text overflow
- Implements proper dispose methods for animation controllers
- **Accessed via Practice Goals icon (⭐) next to search bar, NOT displayed directly on home screen**

## Implementation Correction

**Note**: The initial implementation incorrectly placed the Goals Section directly on the home screen. This has been corrected to follow the user's specification:

1. ✅ **Correct**: Practice Goals icon (⭐) next to search bar → opens dedicated Practice Goals Screen
2. ❌ **Incorrect**: Goals Section embedded directly in home screen layout

The Goals Section content now appears in a clean, full-screen interface accessed through the icon, providing better user experience and maintaining the home screen's primary communication focus.

## Future Enhancements
