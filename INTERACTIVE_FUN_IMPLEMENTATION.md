## Technical Implementation

### Animation Controllers
```dart
// Pop animation with elastic curve
_popAnimationController = AnimationController(duration: 300ms)
_popAnimation = Tween<double>(1.0, 1.2) with Curves.elasticOut

// Burst effect for celebration  
_burstController = AnimationController(duration: 500ms)
_burstAnimation = Tween<double>(0.0, 1.0) with Curves.easeOut
```

- **Spacing**: Generous padding and margins (16px standard)
- **Colors**: High contrast combinations for visual clarity

### State Management
- **Routine Building**: `List<Map<String, String>>` for drag-drop items
- **Shape Matching**: `Map<String, bool>` for completion tracking  
- **Progress**: Integer counters with automatic badge checking
- **Stories**: Index-based navigation with automatic cycling

## ASD-Specific Design Considerations
