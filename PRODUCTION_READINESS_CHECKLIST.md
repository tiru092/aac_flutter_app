- [ ] Backup and data management features working
- [ ] Legal documents web-accessible
- [ ] COPPA compliance verified
- [ ] Beta testing completed with positive feedback
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] Accessibility requirements satisfied

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Asset Generation Delays**: Use placeholder assets for initial testing
2. **Signing Configuration Issues**: Maintain debug signing for development
3. **Testing Shortfalls**: Prioritize critical user flow testing
4. **Legal Compliance**: Consult with legal experts if needed
5. **Performance Issues**: Optimize critical paths first

This checklist ensures all critical aspects of production readiness are addressed systematically, with clear documentation and implementation plans for each requirement.
