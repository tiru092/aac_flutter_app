# Versioning Strategy for AAC Communication Helper

## Versioning Scheme

We use Semantic Versioning (SemVer) for our app releases:
`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`

### MAJOR Version
- Incremented for incompatible API changes
- Significant new features that may require user education
- Major UI/UX redesigns
- Breaking changes to data formats or storage

### MINOR Version
- Incremented for backward-compatible new features
- New functionality that enhances the user experience
- Non-breaking improvements to existing features
- New symbol categories or communication tools

### PATCH Version
- Incremented for backward-compatible bug fixes
- Security patches
- Performance improvements
- Minor UI tweaks and refinements

## Version Number Examples

- `1.0.0` - Initial stable release
- `1.0.1` - Bug fix for symbol loading issue
- `1.1.0` - Added new category management feature
- `2.0.0` - Major redesign with breaking changes

## Release Branching Strategy

### Main Branch
- `main` - Production-ready code
- Only stable, tested releases are merged here

### Development Branches
- `develop` - Main development branch
- Integration branch for features and fixes

### Feature Branches
- `feature/feature-name` - For new features
- Branched from `develop` and merged back when complete

### Release Branches
- `release/vX.Y.Z` - For release preparation
- Branched from `develop` when ready for release
- Merged to both `main` and `develop` when released

### Hotfix Branches
- `hotfix/issue-description` - For urgent production fixes
- Branched from `main` and merged back to both `main` and `develop`

## Release Process

### 1. Planning

- Deploy to app stores
- Merge release branch to `develop`

### 6. Post-Release
